# lastfm-feed

Code to get the recently-scrobbled tracks for a Last.fm user and creating an Atom feed containing the data.

Last.fm documents web feeds at http://www.last.fm/api/feeds. Unfortunately, these feeds seem to have been turned
off some time ago. This code uses the Last.fm API to recreate one of those feeds.
